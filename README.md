These files, mostly [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebook files,
are from trying to solve various
[Project Euler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Euler)
[problems](https://projecteuler.net/archives)
especially at [COhPy](http://www.cohpy.org/) weekly dojos.

Many are to illustrate some point, especially for someone else at a dojo.
Many are just playing around.
Some are serious.
Many can be rendered with
[nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/james-prior/euler/tree/master/).
